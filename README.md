[Ebola Outbreak 2014: How Researchers Use Big Data To Help Stop The Disease](http://www.ibtimes.com/pulse/ebola-outbreak-2014-how-researchers-use-big-data-help-stop-disease-1694907)

## Explain why you found the project interesting. (8 points)

I find it interesting that we are able to predict and track the spread of disease in a way that we never could before. Because we can now collect data from technology so quickly and make it available to researchers that are able to make sense of it and apply predictive algorithms, it is much easier now to prevent disease.

### 2 What types of questions do you think this database could provide insight into? (5 points)

It can provide insight on the relative success of different types of social action. It can be used to predict the outcome of a conflict between various types of groups (ex. countries, protest groups, etc.)

### 5b Do you have any thoughts on why these events are missing geographic information? (5 points)

The top four events that are missing data, non-specific appeal, non-specific make a statement, make a visit, and host a visit probably are missing a lot of data because they are all very common and may be on smaller scales where no one keeps track of where they are. Also, making a statement or appeal does not necessarily need to occur in one specific location.
