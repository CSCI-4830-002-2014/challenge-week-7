[Tracking Syria's Civil War](http://syria.newscientistapps.com/)

## Explain why you found the project interesting. (8 points)

The use of big data and GDELT gives access to all current events that have happened around any generalized area. This instance gave access to seeing how the Syrian protest moved over the years, which could potentially help the government possibly meet protestors in future locations before more violent events happen. Also, the fact that one could graph the amount of violent events through the whole civil war timeline lets viewers know when this war was at its most violent within the country.

### 2 What types of questions do you think this database could provide insight into? (5 points)

This database could provide insight into sanctions countries have enacted on other countries. In this respect, we also could find out, by the Goldstein Scale, you could see if the effects of the sanction raised instability within areas of a specific country. Basically, anything relative to current country events could be found through the use of GDELT.

### 5b Do you have any thoughts on why these events are missing geographic information? (5 points)

Some geographic locations are given a specific eventId but not a given location on the world map. Sometimes events happen in a general area so the location is unknown.
