## Explain why you found the project interesting. (8 points)

I found the article interesting because it takes massive amounts of social
media and brings about the incredibly challenging task of harnessing it into
something useful. One thing I have noticed is that social media is good for
expressing opinions, but often fails with invoking real change. I do not think
that problem is unsolvable. Discussion on important topics can be brought into
the limelight and we can use tools such as relative anonymity and geographic
seperation to expose people to a variety of opinions. It is also interesting
to see the private sector (Twitter) investing millions of dollars into this. I
assume it is because it will most likely pay off to them in the future. This
could be an interesting case of the private sector acting out of its own benefit
yet still helping the greater good.

### 2 What types of questions do you think this database could provide insight into? (5 points)

The GDELT database is essentially a database filled with information about
new events that date back to the 1970s. It is essentially metadata about news
and events, and thus documents societal happening.

This data could be used for many things! One interesting this that could be
done is to graph social trends over the years. You can graph keywords like
"Vietnam war" or "housing bubble" to learning about how news of events or
culture propogates over time.

### 5b Do you have any thoughts on why these events are missing geographic information? (5 points)

The top missing code is Code 43: Travel for a visit. The act of travelling
requires multiple locations, so it would make sense that no single latitude was
encoded. I imagine most of the unencoded ones specifically refer to events
where location is ambiguous.

## Challenges

### 1 (20 points)

I would attempt to correlate how the topic, scale, and frequency of the
demonstrations correlated with the outcome of the UN Climate Summit. Also,
the how united people are on the topic would be a good indicator of the how
something might turn out.

In my visualization, I graphed the number of articles and the Goldstein scale of how much
cooperation there was in the content. I then filtered down only the articles mentioning climate.
From the visualization, it becomes apparent that the United States has lots of buzz around the
topic, and also lots of controversey. The UK seemed to be quite united on the issue, also having
many mentions.

I don't think it would be possible to predict an outcome from this, but it would be useful to
gauge how active people are about the content.
