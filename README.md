[Data Farming: Demonstrating the Benefits of Urban Agriculture ](http://sustainablecitiescollective.com/big-city/133921/data-farming-demonstrating-benefits-urban-agriculture)

## Explain why you found the project interesting. (8 points)

I thought that it was interesting that they could gather data from studies done on urban agriculture and create not only a quick metric framework to help show these benefits, but also are creating an even larger tool that measures more tangible social benefits from students being engaged in urban agriculture activities. The hope is to create an application that find vacant lots in New York City that would be good for urban agriculture, and then measure the effects those cultivated plots have on the community over time. I am very passionate about sustainability, and I think it is great that they are using data to prove the social benefits of sustainable activities such as urban agriculture and make them easier to execute.

### 2 What types of questions do you think this database could provide insight into? (5 points)

So many questions. It can answer whether the world, or certain parts of the world, are becoming more or less stable based on the Goldstein scale. It can can answer what the impact certain events had (for good or for ill). It can also label who the targets are for insurgent activity.

### 5b Do you have any thoughts on why these events are missing geographic information? (5 points)

These most common events that have the highest null values are demands, ues of unconventional mass violence and uses involving nuclear weapons. It may be that groups of terrorists that are said to have nuclear weapons or rockets and are issuing demands are at unknown locations. Demands are not location-specific, either.

## Challenges

### 1 (20 points)

In order to see if the marches truly had an impact on generating action against Climate Change, the data could prove if the marches inspired other major events related to tackling climate change and the impacts of those events for good or for ill. The data can show the impact of marches themselves. You could use the GDELT data specifically to prove this by looking at the impact of the marches themselves using the Goldstein scale.

I filtered my map to the US and the event code being "14" for protest, since it is a march. According to my map, the average Goldstein scale on New York for 9/21/2013 when the marches happened to 9/24/2014 is a 13 out of 20, which means a real score of 3 on the Goldstein scale. This means that the marches were estimated to not have a very large effect on climate policy. The good news is is that the change is a positive one.
