## Explain why you found the project interesting. (8 points)

I work for a Healthcare company, so anything to do with data and health is of interest to me. I especially find it interesting how we can use technology and data to help improve healthcare in developing countries. I find this project interesting because it can help improve healthcare to people who are difficult to reach.

## Challenges

Finding times during the summit where people referenced the marches would show some evidence of the marches making a difference. Events in the GDELT data during the marches and shortly after that include proposals of policy changes and similar actions would show the marches making a difference.
