### 5b Do you have any thoughts on why these events are missing geographic information? (5 points)

Some CAMEO codes were specifically vague on information between the two actors.

## Challenges

### 1 (20 points)
Segregating the data into two sections is the obvious first step: into days before the event, and then those events that on or after the day. Additionally, does the average distribution of event codes change drastically between those two data sections? Are there more peaceful events that take place, or more violent?
