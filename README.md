## Explain why you found the project interesting. (8 points)

This article talked about the big problems in big data for social issues. One of the interesting facts is that The medical industry (one of our biggest social issues is healthcare) is losing about 300 billion dollars a year from mishandled data.

### 5b Do you have any thoughts on why these events are missing geographic information? (5 points)

It seems like the top ones were where parts of the event weren't specified, so the data entered could possibly be incomplete.

## Challenges

### 1 (20 points)
Compare the number of events and the sum of their goldstein scale in the ENV category of events to before and after the march.

I selected several data points comparing before and after the event. We can see that the number of articles skyrocketed the day after in the environmental category. As well, the average tone became higher after the marches. The most interesting point was the goldstein scale, which went way up after the march. I think that these are a good general answer, as we can definitely tell media stories went up after the environment, so I would say the marches had an impact.
