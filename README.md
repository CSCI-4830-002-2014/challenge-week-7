[Big Data Peeps at Your Medical Records to Find Drug Problems](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/07/21/332290342/big-data-peeps-at-your-medical-records-to-find-drug-problems)

## Explain why you found the project interesting. (8 points)

First of all, I found it interesting because it is endorsed by the government, which shows how countries are using big data methods to solve their domestic problems. It also shows how big data can be used to detect trends and to draw parallels about what they mean; in this case adverse side-affects of medical drug usage. I also like that this project aims to help millions of people. Everyone who has ever taken a medical drug can benefit from this project and it's set up in such a way that this approach can be expanded to other national issues involving medicine and even topics outside of medicine.

### 2 What types of questions do you think this database could provide insight into? (5 points)

How do two global events with similar characteristics relate to eachother? 
What types of events are distrubuted globally via the media? What types are neglected by the media?

### 5b Do you have any thoughts on why these events are missing geographic information? (5 points)

The two most missed events are 10 (Make statement, not specific below) and 42 (Make a visit). These events might not contain georgraphical information because they're listed as not specific. This could mean that the data is meant to be ambiguous, or information wasn't published with many details. If the marches affected the summit directly, there would many events reflecting the wishes of the people taking action. You cold use GDELT data to see the frequency of climate change events before the summit and directly after, where you expect to see the biggest impact. 

## Challenges

### 1 (20 points)
You could use the data to show how news articles, tweets, and other forms of information pertaining to the march for change. If the marches are indeed working, then one would expect a high volume of global data pertaining to the marches.

### 3 (20 points)

The data was filtered by Actor1codes, specifically ENV (events pertaining to the environment). For the two days leading up to and the day of the conference. I took the Goldstein scale for the events and found that there was definitely an increase in press in the united states on the day of the conference. What my data failed to show was a strong global increase in ENV events. This may have been due to the fact that I did not include the day after the conference in my data, which may have helped create a better visualization of the impact.
