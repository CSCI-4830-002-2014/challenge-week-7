[argeted Urban Investments to Improve Future Economic Outcomese](http://dssg.uchicago.edu/projects/)

## Explain why you found the project interesting. (8 points)

Economic predictions are a traditionally very difficult science, with some of the brightest programmers and economists in the world still struggling to do better then guessing. The goal by the DSSG group the help the City of Memphis develop predictions about future economic environments will be a difficult one, but it seems that as data becomes "bigger and bigger", these types of economic predictors will likely get more accurate and useful.

### 2 What types of questions do you think this database could provide insight into? (5 points)

After reading about the GDELT project, this data set seems awesome for anyone curious about the interplay of cultures and communities in the last 30 years. It seems like it would be especially useful to historians and anthropologists. It seems that this dataset could provide insight into a huge number of interesting questions, one that I happened to think of is how does the media in a country "shift" before it engages in either an internal or external conflict, and is the "shift" the same for internal and external, or is it represented differently? Another would be to try and examine the "tone" of the media toward one side or the other, how that shifts over time, and if it has any correlation with the eventual "victor" in a conflict.

### 5b Do you have any thoughts on why these events are missing geographic information? (5 points):

The events tend to be either x0 events, which are unspecified in CAMEO -> This means that often times geographic data wouldn't be collected. The "Host and Event" or "Visit an Event" also have many Null Values, which is suprising, but I suppose maybe because of ambiguity between where the host is and who is visiting, maybe the value is ignored? Otherwise it seems like there should be more data on these sorts of events. Actually, it seems that 42 and 43 are simply the most common events, so it isn't surprising that there are more Null values, based on a simple probability.

For events such as the Summit on Climate Change, to judge the "success" of an event, we must first look to see what the goals of such an event were. If the goal was a binding treaty for all attending nations, we will obviously have a different set of "success" codes than if it is suppose to be a non-binding, informal commitment to "do something" about climate change. According to the UN's website, the goal of the summit was to "raise political momentum for a meaningful universal climate agreement in Paris in 2015 and to galvanize transformative action in all countries to reduce emissions and build resilience to the adverse impacts of climate change." -> Thus it is going to be difficult to judge a success, other than encouraging attendance and participation. As the goal was to "Build Momentum", it seems that a count of Media attention before and after the march would be a reasonable way to see if the marches had an impact on momentum building or not.

As discussed, this is somewhat difficult to analyze, to give it a reasonable shot, I included all "cooperative" (root code 1-5 ) activities between actors that were happening in New York over these 4 days. I tried to limit it farther, but had difficulty in deciding specifically what cooperative events would have happened at the UN summit in New York City. We see the media events/sources about as we would have predicted, a slow rising up to the 23rd, and then a decline in the follow days, the decline was slower than the rise, though. So we may be able to say that the rallies world wide were "successful" so far as the gathered media attention on the day of the summit, and had continuing discussion in the days following as well.
