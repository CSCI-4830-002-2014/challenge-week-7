## Explain why you found the project interesting. (8 points)

I would never have thought about vaccines going bad, but I'm sure people in the healthcare business think about this. Its also a service directly helping people, which doesn't always happen.

### 2 What types of questions do you think this database could provide insight into? (5 points)

It seems that this dataset could be used to look into political events, and how political information travels around.

### 5b Do you have any thoughts on why these events are missing geographic information? (5 points)

In any given data set, it won't always be clean, there are 13000 vaild datapoints to 200 invalid datapoints with the code 10, often times data isn't clear enough to get clear data in every field.

## Challenges

### 1 (20 points)

Proving the impact of an event is always hard to do, because correlation does not imply causation. A surefire way of proving that the climate summit made an impact is determining if they changed political stances as a result of the summit. With GDELT data, this could be done by using the data prior to and in the days following the climate summit, and looking at political leaders response to see if there is a significant change in the Goldstein scale.

Again with Big data, no answer is ever as easy to get as we would like. The problem we have with this dataset is that there isn't before and after data for all of the countries. This might be able to be seen is we manually looked at the countries with valid datasets, but the wider range of dates we look at, the more we will have to be aware of other simulating events.
