Often, on public events or rumers, the events might not have a geo location.

## Challenges

### 1 (20 points)
We can visualize the average number of events regarding climate change and environment before and after each demonstration and see if the number of events regarding climate change increase. In GDELT data, we have events with their occurance date. We can simply filter out the non-climate change events to visualize what is described previously.

As you can see, the number of articles about "Environment" has increased on the day of event and started to decrease back to where it was before the event afterwards.
