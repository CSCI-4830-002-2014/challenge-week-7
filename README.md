It was nearly impossible to figure out how to get the stupid map to show up for the entire world. I couldn't figure out the dimensions or anything for the latitude and longitude.

## Explain why you found the project interesting. (8 points)

I've heard about GiveDirectly and their unorthodox approaches to fighting poverty on an NPR Planet Money podcast months ago. I love that, despite what people think about just giving away money instead of food or utilities, simply handing over cash to poor people really works for the most part. Most people are smart enough to use the money to help their families, many of which aren't even short term. This article talks about targeting rooftop types amongst different villages to see the ratio of sheet metal roofs (better) to thatch roofs (worse). But the podcast also talks about people how buy livestock and sell it's milk to make a profit. Or one of the villagers saved up his funds to buy a moped type vehicle and run a small taxi service. It's incredible to see people really using funding that is just voluntarily being given to them instead of blowing it away. They really try to make a difference.

### 2 What types of questions do you think this database could provide insight into? (5 points)

1. When there is news that is meant to be broadcasted on an international level, how fast does it reach all major countries around the world?
2. What country has the highest concentration of news coming from it, and how dependable/respectable is that news to other countries?
3. Where is there a particularly high rate of news on a specific topic (i.e. crime, politics, etc.)

### 5b Do you have any thoughts on why these events are missing geographic information? (5 points)

Considering the two events with the largest number of records (considerably larger than even the third highest) are 'make a visit' and 'host a visit', it does not surprise me that there is no geographic information. These events were likely private and not meant to share location publically.

There is an infographic that talks about how many social media posts were put out during this event (~630,000), so you could easily use natural language processing to detect tone and emotion within each post to see if there is a general theme people are rallying towards. There were also ~5,200 articles written about this event, all of which would provide a lot of data, especially if you find out the concentration of articles written about the event over a certain period of time. This is where the GDELT data could come in handy. By parsing through event CAMEO codes, number of records, geographic location, popularity, etc. I'm sure there is compelling evidence that this march had an impact.

You can see from this data that not only were the number of 'environmentally' tagged articles more than doubled on the 23rd and 24th, but the density of the number of mentions is also much higher per article. It can be seen that both before and after the 23rd and 24th, there is a clear dropoff of data being spread around the globe on environmental issues. Of course, to make this truly convincing, more detailed information would have to be provided, and a wide data set would also be needed. It would also be neat to compare the number of articles and mentions tagged 'environmental for this particular event compared to other environmentally-based events.
