I initially couldn’t get my data working on Tableau.  After to speaking with Chris in class, it turned out that my use of Excel to view the data was corrupting the formatting.

[FBI to Start Tracking Animal Cruelty](http://blog.humanesociety.org/wayne/2014/09/animal-cruelty-uniform-crime-report.html)

## Explain why you found the project interesting. (8 points)

Until recently, animal cruelty cases were not uniquely categorized in the Uniform Crime Report, making it difficult to identify problem regions or notable correlations.  However, local and federal agencies will now track animal cruelty and animal neglect cases and report them under their own category.  

Law enforcement agencies expect that, with this change, they will be able to better “allocate officers and financial resources to handle these cases, track trends and deploy accordingly.”  I am very enthusiastic about this new effort because it will allow nonprofits and government agencies to make more informed and effective decisions when approaching this problem.

### 2 What types of questions do you think this database could provide insight into? (5 points)

This database seems like it would be a fantastic tool for supporting sociological hypotheses.  Since the data is comprised of “print, broadcast, and web formats, in over 100 languages” since 1979, we have data that supports comparisons of opinion and expression across culture and time.  Some questions that may be of interest to users of this data are:

1. How does the geographic and demographic information of internet users generally evolve over time?
2. What are different nationalities’ responses to various crises.
3. Can we identify communication between different actors?

### 5b Do you have any thoughts on why these events are missing geographic information? (5 points)

According to the site, the CAMEO event code data is a “collection of more than 300 types of events organized into a hierarchical taxonomy and recorded in the files as a numeric code”.  This data is likely missing geographic information because the geography cannot be deduced from the content or is was incorrectly inserted into the database.

## Challenges

### 1 (20 points)
To “prove” that a the climate marches had some sort of impact, we would primarily want to investigate the social responses on and around the time of the protests with an event code of “PROTEST” or similar.  We could also see how communication changed on September 23 by looking at event codes and the geographic proximity to the protests.

A challenge that could arise would be differentiating between the impact of the protests and the impact of the UN Climate Summit event itself, but hopefully we can use event codes to help filter this.

I do think that this could be useful in determining if the marches had an impact, but “prove” is a strong word.  This data can support the case that the marches had an impact (you can see the evolution of protests and related media grew substantially on the 23rd), but it is by no means scientific data because of the many possible variables.
