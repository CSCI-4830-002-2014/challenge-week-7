## Explain why you found the project interesting. (8 points)

The use of big data and GDELT gives access to all current events that have happened around any generalized area. This instance gave access to seeing how the Syrian protest moved over the years, which could potentially help the government possibly meet protestors in future locations before more violent events happen. Also, the fact that one could graph the amount of violent events through the whole civil war timeline lets viewers know when this war was at its most violent within the country.

### 2 What types of questions do you think this database could provide insight into? (5 points)

This database could provide insight into sanctions countries have enacted on other countries. In this respect, we also could find out, by the Goldstein Scale, you could see if the effects of the sanction raised instability within areas of a specific country. Basically, anything relative to current country events could be found through the use of GDELT.

### 5b Do you have any thoughts on why these events are missing geographic information? (5 points)

Some geographic locations are given a specific eventId but not a given location on the world map. Sometimes events happen in a general area so the location is unknown.

To find the impact of this event, you would most likely track the eventId, identify it on the global map, and use the Goldstein scale to see if this caused more/less stability in that area of the US. Another method could be identifying the environment and climate before and after the march in New York. If the number of events increased in that time then we can assume that it caused a rise in activities around the event.

After the September 23rd event, the number of articles rose along with the tone associated with the recorded movements. Weeks before the event there was a small amount of articles input. After the event, the number of articles input rose which shows that the September 23rd event led to a temporary rise in acitivity throughout the world the day after. September 24th shows the greatest day of article activity in this diagram.
