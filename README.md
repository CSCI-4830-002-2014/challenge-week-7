## Explain why you found the project interesting. (8 points)

I think it is very interesting to see how big data is being used to solve real problems in the world and predict how eviction rates relate to homelessness. 

# GDELT (I) (5 points x 6 + 20 points x 3 = 90 points)

### 2 What types of questions do you think this database could provide insight into? (5 points)

I think this dataset could be very useful to provide insight into:
1. Who are prevelant actors in the world today.
2. Where the most influential actors are located in the world today.
3. How a global event affects different coutries differently.

### 5b Do you have any thoughts on why these events are missing geographic information? (5 points)

I think that some of these events are missing geographic data because some mistakes were probably made when obtaining the data. Since the data set is so large some mistakes are bound to happen.

## Challenges

### 1 (20 points)
Proving that marches made an impact is a hard thing to do because correlation does not prove causation. One way we could do this is to look at 
GDEL data, and examine the Goldstein scale to see if anything was affected by these marches. 

### 2 (20 points)

### 3 (20 points)

I think that my findings could be useful for finding out this information but it would need to be further investegated to really understand what is going on here.
