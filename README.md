### 5b Do you have any thoughts on why these events are missing geographic information? (5 points)

The top four events that are missing data, non-specific appeal, non-specific make a statement, make a visit, and host a visit probably are missing a lot of data because they are all very common and may be on smaller scales where no one keeps track of where they are. Also, making a statement or appeal does not necessarily need to occur in one specific location.
