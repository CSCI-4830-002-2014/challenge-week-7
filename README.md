### 5b Do you have any thoughts on why these events are missing geographic information? (5 points)

Often, on public events or rumers, the events might not have a geo location.

## Challenges

### 1 (20 points)
We can visualize the average number of events regarding climate change and environment before and after each demonstration and see if the number of events regarding climate change increase. In GDELT data, we have events with their occurance date. We can simply filter out the non-climate change events to visualize what is described previously.
