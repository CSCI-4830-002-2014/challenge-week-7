[Ebola Outbreak 2014: How Researchers Use Big Data To Help Stop The Disease](http://www.ibtimes.com/pulse/ebola-outbreak-2014-how-researchers-use-big-data-help-stop-disease-1694907)

## Explain why you found the project interesting. (8 points)

I find it interesting that we are able to predict and track the spread of disease in a way that we never could before. Because we can now collect data from technology so quickly and make it available to researchers that are able to make sense of it and apply predictive algorithms, it is much easier now to prevent disease.

### 2 What types of questions do you think this database could provide insight into? (5 points)

It can provide insight on the relative success of different types of social action. It can be used to predict the outcome of a conflict between various types of groups (ex. countries, protest groups, etc.)

### 5b Do you have any thoughts on why these events are missing geographic information? (5 points)

The top four events that are missing data, non-specific appeal, non-specific make a statement, make a visit, and host a visit probably are missing a lot of data because they are all very common and may be on smaller scales where no one keeps track of where they are. Also, making a statement or appeal does not necessarily need to occur in one specific location.

## Challenges

### 1 (20 points)

In general, you can perform sentiment analysis on social data to find out general impressions of the UN Climate Summit. You can mark everyone that has been exposed to the protest, what their previous impressions were on "environment" keywords, and what they were at the time of the protest. You can then find out who has the most influence on the decisions separately through graph theory. You can measure the success then by weighting the amount of people who previously either did not post about the environment or posted negatively about it that now do based on their influence on decisions. In the case of the GDELT data, you could compare the amount of mentions and their tone over the days leading up to the event.

I did my analysis by filtering the data by the primary type code for ENV in an attempt to filter out unrelated events. I then plotted the events on a map with the size of circles indicating the number of mentions and green/red indicating the positive/negative tone of the mentions respectively. What I found was that although the number of mentions decreased leading up to the Climate Summit, they increased dramatically on the day of the Climate Summit and the tone switched from negative to positive.
