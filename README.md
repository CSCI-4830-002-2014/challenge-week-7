# What is the most difficult part about this week's challenge?
SWITCHING PARTITIONS. I hate that we have so many tools that are not completely compatable on all distros... So I had to switch back and forth from Linux to Windows 4 times since Tableau Desktop is not for Linux and my Node.js is all chill only on my Linux distro...

[Two-screen laptops: complete overkill, or completely logical?](http://www.pcauthority.com.au/News/264208,two-screen-laptops-complete-overkill-or-completely-logical.aspx)

## Explain why you found the project interesting. (8 points)
Laptops have never yielded enough screen space for partner programming to be comfortable. Two-screen laptops == problem solved. I love laptops, but their screens are always too small.

### 2 What types of questions do you think this database could provide insight into? (5 points)
Questions pertaining to events. We can answer "What day world events occurred" or "Where did the event occer", or "Who were involved in an event". We can also answer questions about the affiliations of the actors involved in the event. Such as religious or racial associations.

### 5b Do you have any thoughts on why these events are missing geographic information? (5 points)
The most popular event 10 is a publicly made and recorded comment on the event. Which is not always associated with a location.
The second most popular event is 20 and is a plea made on behalf of the actor. This is yet again not often associated to a location because it is a public event or rumor. Both events could occur through social media as well, which would certainly raise the likelihood of a "lack of location"

In order to prove if a march made an impact on the climate change legislation, we can get a sum of the amount of events pertaining to environmental change. Now we plot the sums of these articles by date. If there is an increase of events on the day of September 23rd, 2015, we have our problem solved. In order to get a good range, we will pick days to measure in the following pattern. ("/" gets no data analysis while "0" is a day for data analysis). This is the week of the event:
0//0//0(event)//0//0

Yes, we certainly proved that the march had an impact worldwide. we proved this by not only showing a global map of locations for where environmental events (for actor 1) were located to be. In addition, I have a volume graph to show how many articles were published pertaining to the environment for actor 1. There was a ~500 article increase on September 23rd in comparison to September 17th or September 29th. Clearly there was publicity for this event in large volumes, so hopefully there was legislation change!
