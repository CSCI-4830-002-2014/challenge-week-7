[Data Farming: Demonstrating the Benefits of Urban Agriculture ](http://sustainablecitiescollective.com/big-city/133921/data-farming-demonstrating-benefits-urban-agriculture)

## Explain why you found the project interesting. (8 points)

I thought that it was interesting that they could gather data from studies done on urban agriculture and create not only a quick metric framework to help show these benefits, but also are creating an even larger tool that measures more tangible social benefits from students being engaged in urban agriculture activities. The hope is to create an application that find vacant lots in New York City that would be good for urban agriculture, and then measure the effects those cultivated plots have on the community over time. I am very passionate about sustainability, and I think it is great that they are using data to prove the social benefits of sustainable activities such as urban agriculture and make them easier to execute.
